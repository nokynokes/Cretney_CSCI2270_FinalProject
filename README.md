# Cretney_CSCI2270_FinalProject
Final project

My final project is going to be a hash tables in which the program read in a file with a list
of video games from my steam library and finds the hash value for each title and stores into an array. I have not decided on what the array size will be
The user will be able to search for game by title or genre. Each game will also come with a price and the user will be able to choose if they would like to buy it.
